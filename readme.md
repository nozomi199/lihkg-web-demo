LIHKG WEB Client Demo

BY summer~@mysunshine

This is a LIHKG web reader in single file.
It follow the simple way to design and use.
It is no any visual effects, just keep it simple and fast, and demostration its API.
It is not support login system, because original LIHKG apps is better.
It is no any additional js lib to increase loading.

usage: open html in chrome is ok. 
Edge, firefox may not tested.

ALSO YOU MAY USE ADOBE PHONEGAP BUILDER TO PACK IT INTO WEBAPPS

Hope you have a miracle experience start from my demo code.

Special thanks.
